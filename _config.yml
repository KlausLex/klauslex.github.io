  Hi, I'm Klaus.<br>
  I'm a mechanical engineer based in Vienna, Austria currently studying robotics.
  
  During my studies I've been using mostly <mark>MATLAB</mark> but also some <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>ROS</mark>.<br>
  The most interesting areas for me so far were related to <mark>perception</mark> and <mark>navigation</mark>.<br>
  This is also what I'm looking for: Robotics research.
