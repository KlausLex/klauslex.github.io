  Hi, I'm Klaus - Vienna-based PhD student in EE.<br>

  I'm currently working in the area of <mark>artificial intelligence</mark>, <mark>computer vision</mark> & <mark>sensor fusion</mark>.
  During my studies I've primarily been working on industrial applications and got interested in perception.

  <mark>One day I'll leave the applied fields for more fundamental work, such as locomotion for bipeds / quadrupeds or perception in the drone space.</mark><br>

  When I'm not working, I serve as VP for the great science festival <mark>Pint of Science Austria</mark>, where I also organize and occasionally host tech-related scientists to present their work, or manage analogue research projects at the <mark>Austrian Space Forum</mark>.

  The little time I have left spend on a mixture of:
   - What "little" time is left, you dummy?
   - <s>Photography</s>  
   - <s>3D printing (Elegoo Mars Pro)</s>  
   - <s>3D-Modelling in my favorite modeller <mark>BLENDER</mark></s>  
   - <s>Image editing in <mark>Affinity Suite</mark> and <mark>Adobe Lightroom</mark> as well as</s>  
   - <s>Video editing in <mark>Vegas</mark> and <mark>Final Cut</mark></s>
