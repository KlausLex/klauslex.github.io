  Hi, I'm Klaus - Vienna-based engineer & robotics student.<br>
  
  During my studies I've been using mostly <mark>MATLAB</mark> but also some <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>C++</mark> & <mark>ROS</mark>.<br>
  The most interesting areas for me so far were related to <mark>SLAM</mark>.<br>
  I have experience working in project management, engineering and software development.<br>
  This includes working with industrial robots such as <mark>ABB</mark>, <mark>KUKA</mark> & <mark>Universal Robots</mark>, as well as working with various SoC or ÂµCs, like a <mark>Raspberry Pi</mark>, <mark>NVIDIA Jetson</mark>, <mark>Arduino</mark> & <mark>OpenCR</mark>, as well as sensors and cameras of different brands like <mark>Cognex</mark>, <mark>Basler</mark>, <mark>ydLidar</mark>.<br>
  
  <br>
  <mark>I'm actively looking for a position as a phd student to work on autonomous mobile robots in the wild starting in 2023.</mark><br>
