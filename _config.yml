  Hi, I'm Klaus.<br>
  
  I'm a mechanical engineer based in Vienna, Austria currently studying robotics.
  
  Currently I'm looking into opportunities to get into robotics research.
  During my studies I've been using mostly <mark>MATLAB</mark> but also some <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>ROS</mark>.<br>
  The most interesting areas for me so far were related to <mark>perception</mark> and <mark>navigation</mark>.<br>
  I also got the chance to get valuable practical experience working for a great robotics startup based here in Vienna.<br>
  
  There are still a lot of things I do not know but I'm always excited in learning something new!

  Currently I also explore options in Scientific Communication and joined the <mark>Pint of Science Austria</mark>

  The little time I have left spend on a mixture of:
   - 3D printing (Elegoo Mars Pro)
   - 3D-Modelling in my favorite modeller <mark>BLENDER</mark>
   - 3D-Modelling in my least favorite modeller <mark>FreeCAD</mark> (I'm sorry but you're breaking everything I learned so far)
   - Image editing in <mark>Affinity Suite</mark> and <mark>Adobe Lightroom</mark> as well as
   - Video editing in <mark>Vegas</mark> and <mark>Final Cut</mark>
