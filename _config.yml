  Hi, my name's Klaus and I love <mark>#robotics</mark>.

  I have a background in <mark>#mechanical engineering</mark> and pursue a masters in <mark>#robotics and automation</mark> at the moment.<br>
  Working in the fields of <mark>#manufacturing</mark> and <mark>#project management</mark> during my studies gave me the chance me learn a lot and improved my <mark>#teamworking</mark> skills while also learning some <mark>#leadership</mark>.
  
  Now I'm looking for chances to mostly expand on my skills in <mark>#programming</mark> which I still need a lot of practice in.<br>
  In the meantime I'm taking several <mark>#MOOC</mark> and spend way too much time on <mark>#Twitter</mark>
