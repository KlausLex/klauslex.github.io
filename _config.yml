  Hi, I'm Klaus.<br>
  
  I'm a engineer based in Vienna, Austria studying robotics.
  
  During my studies I've been using mostly <mark>MATLAB</mark> but also some <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>ROS</mark>.<br>
  The most interesting areas for me so far were related to <mark>SLAM</mark>.<br>
  I have experience working in project management, engineering and software development.<br>
  This includes working with industrial robots (<mark>ABB</mark>, <mark>Universal Robots</mark>) & cameras (<mark>Cognex</mark>).<br>
  
  <br>
  <mark>I'm looking for opportunities in academic research to work on autonomous mobile robots.</mark><br>

  Currently I also explore options in Scientific Communication and joined the <mark>Pint of Science Austria</mark> as event manager and moderator.

  The little time I have left spend on a mixture of:
   - 3D printing (Elegoo Mars Pro)
   - 3D-Modelling in my favorite modeller <mark>BLENDER</mark>
   - 3D-Modelling in my least favorite modeller <mark>FreeCAD</mark> (I'm sorry but you're breaking everything I learned so far)
   - Image editing in <mark>Affinity Suite</mark> and <mark>Adobe Lightroom</mark> as well as
   - Video editing in <mark>Vegas</mark> and <mark>Final Cut</mark>
