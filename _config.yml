  Hi, my name's Klaus and I love <mark>#robotics</mark>.

  I have a background in <mark>#mechanical engineering</mark> and currently pursue a masters in <mark>#robotics and automation</mark>.<br>
  While working during my studies I learned a lot in the fields of <mark>#manufacturing </mark> and <mark>#project management</mark> and also had the chance to improve my <mark>#teamworking</mark> skills and took charge of <mark>#leadership</mark> for some projects.
  
  Now I'm looking for chances to expand on my skills in <mark>#programming</mark> which I still need a lot of practice in.<br>
  In the meantime I take several <mark>#MOOC</mark> and spend too much time on <mark>#Twitter</mark>
