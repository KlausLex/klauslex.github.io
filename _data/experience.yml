#    Machines and products needs adress as many people as possible and industrial products are no exception. Creating manuals pleasing to the eye and easy to understand is hard and I give my best to ensure operations are handled safe and without regards to educational background. I am currently working together in a team of 5 people and we aid each other to the best of our abilities, which I really like!
