    During my time at University West I learnt most of my key skills such as <mark>software development</mark> fundamentals of <mark>image processing</mark>, as well as working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time supporting lecturers throughout their courses online and taking on roles such as *Teaching Assistant* and *Seminar Leader* where I led discussions on courses and student talks.
